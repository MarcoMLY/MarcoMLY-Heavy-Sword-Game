# MarcoMLY-Heavy-Sword-Game
Ths game is a top down, 2D, open world, sword throwing game where you play as a character with a very heavy sword. To use it, you have to spin it around and then throw it.

This is a game Iv'e been working on for a few months where you use your characters movement to spin a sword around which is attached to your character, let go of the sword and watch it fly into enemies, crystals and walls, then return to you.
You can use the sword to stick into enemies and crystals, and then pull it back to deal extra damage, but while its still stuck, your character will move faster without all the weight.
However, you have limited oxygen, and you must return before it runs out, and then fill up your oxygen tanks by extracting oxygen from the minerals youve collected.
If you dont have any minerals, then, you'll have to find some before you oxygen tanks run out.
If you dont have any full or partially full oxygen tanks, then you've run out of luck!
But don't worry, you can load previous days in case this happens, or something else which you are unhappy about.

I hope to release it by the end of next year.
If I do, and you play it, I hope you enjoy :)
